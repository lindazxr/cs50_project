# My Plants

## Plant Care App

* Remembering watering schedules across multiple plants can be tough
* This app aims to help you keep track of when you last watered your plants
* Project status: prototype


## Content

The web app is built using Flask as my CS50 final project.

There are two main pages on the web app
* My Garden: where you can add new plants
* Water: Where you can check when is the next plant to be watered. Functionalities include 'water' today or 'postpone' for a day

## To Do

Plan to add the following functions to the web app
* Separate plants into different spaces (e.g. living room, bathroom)
* Add avatars for each plant
